Rice
=====

Rice is a Drift City server emulator that aims to be compatible with the latest available version of the official client.

Status
=====

Rice's development by the original developers has continued privately as a result of a severe lack of community effort. 
For the curious, a commit feed is available [here](https://rotago.me/rice/).

This outdated version is a very barebones project for a Drift City emulator and no longer represents the features of the private version.
The project remains on GitHub as a reference for any curious developers. Most (if not all) contributing pull requests will be merged.
